# GooPyCharts vs MATLAB

## Advantages
- It uses Python! One big advantage here is text/file processing
- It is free!
- Tooltips! (You highlight a point on the graph and it tells you what the point is)
- Prettier
- Integrates well with the web. It is very simple to embed a graph produced by GooPyCharts into a webpage (just copy the HTML, if you are interested in doing this and have questions, just ask).

## Disadvantages
- Limited features. MATLAB has a lot more features and is overall more powerful
- Static plots. MATLAB has an incredible array of plot editing tools after display that GooPyCharts and Matplotlib cannot match.
